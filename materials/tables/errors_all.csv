what is the reason for my daughter constipation and stomach pain hi doctor my 18 month old daughter has had problems since birth and I am desperate for a second opinion the history is complicated trying to explain the symptoms but I will do my best it was detected polyhydramnios in pregnancy my daughter born at 36 weeks days through emergency section due to pre eclampsia her weight was 3070g no tube passed three times due to polyhydramnios we went home on day two readmitted on day five for phototherapy till months of age several visits with health visitor and go for colic like symptoms and constipation she will scream in pain which opening her bowel and only opening her bowels every four to five days over this time they tried colief infacol lactulose glycerin suppositories ranitidine gaviscon and domperidone nine different formulas and we also tried all common natural remedies for reflux like keeping upright after feeding etc no alleviation of symptoms at all with exception of glycerin suppositories which did seem to help the constipation in months pediatric consultant suggests functional constipation and recommends higher dose of lactulose and movicol for 16 weeks he suggested that we are giving her too many glycerin suppositories and that is making her dependent on glycerin to open her bowels and so glycerin was stopped we delayed weaning whilst waiting for appointment at this point her symptoms completely changed to intermittent diarrhea and constipation bowel frequency increased to once a day colic like pain and she does not start vomiting until the consistency of the food moves up to a more solid consistency the laxatives made absolutely no difference in her 10 months of age the constipation has turned to diarrhea the doctor is happy that it was functional constipation and discharged her at months she had first acute episode of chronic diarrhea and forceful vomiting lasted for 16 days which coincides with the introduction of cow milk during 14 months of age she was introduced to solid food chronic forceful vomiting which does not seem to follow any pattern a food diary is followed for several weeks and there does not seem to be any consistent non ice allergy as a cause during her 14 months of age we had an appointment with dietician and switched from normal formula to pepsi and then neocate her chronic wheeze disappears overnight but chronic vomiting continues she troubleshoot overfeeding as a cause we are feeding her more as she is vomiting when we did not substitute the feeds she lost weight so if she vomited a feed we gave her another one hour later we fed her small quantities throughout the day to try and prevent vomiting again in 15 months consulted her dietician and he suggested definite non ice cow milk protein allergy and to try trial and error with other three common allergies soy wheat and dairy so then for a month we followed strict elimination of those three this month she had only neocate liquid diet plus corn snacks organix and one paella meal symptoms improved but sporadic forceful vomiting remains she tolerated only one baby paella meal well which is overcooked rice very mushy consistency now again we attempted to challenge the three foods back in and move beyond this one meal all attempts were failed her reaction to us seems to be much more about the consistency of the food rather than what the food is she can tolerate a large amount of breadcrumbs but cannot tolerate a piece of toast we continue with food diary and there really is no clear pattern which isolates one food again in her 17 months age when we consulted her dietician he was unsure whether the symptoms fit flies at all and suggests gastro referral then she had second acute episode we went a and on day five and was sent home with suggestion of gastroenteritis chronic vomiting and diarrhea lasted 15 days she lost 10 of her body weight sent home on neocate as the only diet but there is no evidence of gagging choking or problem swallowing no fussing or wriggling during feeding four months back her weight was 12 keg and now 10 keg her barium ray showed mild malrotation but at met it was decided this was not explanation of symptoms we have recently tried omeprazole to rule out severe reflux and it made no change genetic blood tests kidney and abdominal ultrasound were normal for us her symptoms now are identical to what they were like before the onset of weaning again she is suffering from intermittent colic pain and constipation but there is no vomiting she is not sleeping well at all we have increased her water intake and added lactulose and the stools are no longer hard but she still seems uncomfortable stools are very dark green we have tried a couple of solids she prefers crunchy food she tolerates corn based crisps as they basically dissolve into crumbs into your mouth we tried peas grapes and she passed all of the peas grapes and beans completely undigested in her feces without solids she does not sleep well at all because the neocate just does not fill her up for long enough and so she is screaming all night because she is hungry so we tried a few solids and she is still screaming half the night with colic like pain she is clearly in pain because she is absolutely screaming she is pretty inconsolable but the only thing that does relieve it is sucking on something like a bottle of water she is waking up about every 20 to 30 minutes throughout the night during the day she still has this colic like symptoms and she is tired and clingy and uninterested in playing she does tend to have one to two hours a day of good time where she will play happily one month back we had consultation with slt her elder sister is under

exception of glycerin suppositories which did seem to help the constipation in months pediatric consultant suggests functional constipation and recommends higher dose of lactulose and movicol for 16 weeks he suggested that we are giving her too many glycerin suppositories and that is making her dependent on glycerin to open her bowels and so glycerin was stopped we delayed weaning whilst waiting for appointment at this point her symptoms completely changed to intermittent diarrhea and constipation bowel frequency increased to once a day colic like pain and she does not start vomiting until the consistency of the food moves up to a more solid consistency the laxatives made absolutely no difference in her 10 months of age the constipation has turned to diarrhea the doctor is happy that it was functional constipation and discharged her at months she had first acute episode of chronic diarrhea and forceful vomiting lasted for 16 days which coincides with the introduction of cow milk during 14 months of age she was introduced to solid food chronic forceful vomiting which does not seem to follow any pattern a food diary is followed for several weeks and there does not seem to be any consistent non ice allergy as a cause during her 14 months of age we had an appointment with dietician and switched from normal formula to pepsi and then neocate her chronic wheeze disappears overnight but chronic vomiting continues she troubleshoot overfeeding as a cause we are feeding her more as she is vomiting when we did not substitute the feeds she lost weight so if she vomited a feed we gave her another one hour later we fed her small quantities throughout the day to try and prevent vomiting again in 15 months consulted her dietician and he suggested definite non ice cow milk protein allergy and to try trial and error with other three common allergies soy wheat and dairy so then for a month we followed strict elimination of those three this month she had only neocate liquid diet plus corn snacks organix and one paella meal symptoms improved but sporadic forceful vomiting remains she tolerated only one baby paella meal well which is overcooked rice very mushy consistency now again we attempted to challenge the three foods back in and move beyond this one meal all attempts were failed her reaction to us seems to be much more about the consistency of the food rather than what the food is she can tolerate a large amount of breadcrumbs but cannot tolerate a piece of toast we continue with food diary and there really is no clear pattern which isolates one food again in her 17 months age when we consulted her dietician he was unsure whether the symptoms fit flies at all and suggests gastro referral then she had second acute episode we went a and on day five and was sent home with suggestion of gastroenteritis chronic vomiting and diarrhea lasted 15 days she lost 10 of her body weight sent home on neocate as the only diet but there is no evidence of gagging choking or problem swallowing no fussing or wriggling during feeding four months back her weight was 12 keg and now 10 keg her barium ray showed mild malrotation but at met it was decided this was not explanation of symptoms we have recently tried omeprazole to rule out severe reflux and it made no change genetic blood tests kidney and abdominal ultrasound were normal for us her symptoms now are identical to what they were like before the onset of weaning again she is suffering from intermittent colic pain and constipation but there is no vomiting she is not sleeping well at all we have increased her water intake and added lactulose and the stools are no longer hard but she still seems uncomfortable stools are very dark green we have tried a couple of solids she prefers crunchy food she tolerates corn based crisps as they basically dissolve into crumbs into your mouth we tried peas grapes and she passed all of the peas grapes and beans completely undigested in her feces without solids she does not sleep well at all because the neocate just does not fill her up for long enough and so she is screaming all night because she is hungry so we tried a few solids and she is still screaming half the night with colic like pain she is clearly in pain because she is absolutely screaming she is pretty inconsolable but the only thing that does relieve it is sucking on something like a bottle of water she is waking up about every 20 to 30 minutes throughout the night during the day she still has this colic like symptoms and she is tired and clingy and uninterested in playing she does tend to have one to two hours a day of good time where she will play happily one month back we had consultation with slt her elder sister is under

pelvic ultrasound suggest endometriosis and adenomyosis will they cause infertility in long run hello doctor I am a 32 year old female I had my second baby via section a couple of months after I started getting pelvic pain the pain is across my whole pelvic area and lower back and some times in my thighs too very similar to menstrual cramps occasionally I would get a sharp pain on either side of my pelvic area especially on the right side I also get pelvic cramps every time after sexual intercourse and occasional pain when I go to the toilet the pain is bearable and when it gets a little worse I can manage it by taking pain killers I get the pain almost every single day as well not just when I am on my period my periods have always been very heavy and painful from the beginning but have been able to keep it under control by taking the combined contraceptive pill gedarel 30 150 my and mefenamic acid which I have been taking for many years I have also been getting headaches and I am always very tired due to the lack of sleep I get from these pains during the night half the time I feel very stressed out because of the way I am feeling and it is not easy being a mom of two young children as well and having to manage with the pains etc I eventually visited the go and had some tests done such as smear tests infection swabs blood tests and an ultrasound scan everything was normal but the transvaginal ultrasound showed I have endometriosis and adenomyosis I was referred to a specialist gynecologist and although he has given me a course of action to follow for the next six months I felt that the appointment was a bit rushed and I had a lot of questions to ask regarding the two conditions I would really like to ask a few questions regarding the conditions as soon as possible because my next appointment is not for another six months and there are a few things I would like to know about how these two conditions will affect me in the long run I just need some answers for peace of mind nothing specific to me but more about the disease itself the doctor has advised to take the combined contraceptive pill for another six months without a break and to take pain killers as and when required the consultant also mentioned progesterone based methods but we had to rule that out as it causes hair loss and I have been through years of a form of alopecia and have just managed to get my hair back I have tried asking doctors online and have been conned by them because they have taken money from me and just copied and pasted answers from other places online which made me quite upset and furious hopefully someone from here can give me proper and professional answers these are the following questions I would like to ask what causes these two conditions I am aware that these two conditions cannot be 100 diagnosed via imaging methods and laparoscopy is the only method that provides a definitive diagnosis so how can a clinician be sure that they are treating me for the right condition and it is not something worse how will these conditions affect me in the long run if they begin the progress which out of the two endometriosis or adenomyosis is more severe and serious how will they affect my fertility and what would happen if I wanted to have another baby in the future will it be hard to get pregnant will it cause problems to either me or the baby is there an increased risk of miscarriages and preterm labor and if so how likely is this what if I were to come off the pill for whatever reason how can I manage these conditions are there any other methods or a form of lifestyle I can follow to help such as certain dietary intakes etc how can I prevent getting pain when I go to the toilet mainly passing stool and help with sleep any other information will be greatly appreciated also are there any online groups or support websites for these conditions,2,2,1,0.4556732773780823,True,high,medium,724,FNN,"['class_overlap', 'linguistic_ambiguity']",class_overlap
