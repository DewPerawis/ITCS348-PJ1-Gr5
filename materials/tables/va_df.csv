how to control gingival recession caused due to esophageal hernia and acid reflux,hi I checked your query and attached files I can totally understand the situation you are going through the best part is you know the root cause is stomach issue you are doing best and accurate already to keep the oh maintained I would like to add some points do saline water mouth rinses instead of normal water rinses take a pinch of salt in a half cup of lukewarm water and do its rinse before sleeping and after breakfast do it for one week this is the best remedy by book and by practice so far for strengthening the gums as healthy gums will grow they will attach to tooth more firmly change your brushing habit do brush with very light hand pressure this canine tooth root exposure as is evident in the picture clearly indicates that while brushing unconsciously more pressure or harsh brushing is done at this corner of the mouth so if this is the case try breaking down your habit this will prevent gum from going down further at this stage extraction is not recommended take brufen 400 my twice a day for three days this will cover the inflammatory condition at the gum line of this sensitive tooth now get slight scaling done of this area and get neck filling done again this will save the tooth do not brush this area as it is very sensitive oral gel revomet plus metronidazole and chlorhexidine gel can help with swollen gums put at the affected part thrice a day for five days do all these recommended things and please give me followup after five days I hope this helps acidic oh of mouth due to stomach problem and hard brushing habit it would be very helpful if a pa ray is done of lower right canine filling act root canal treatment filling and scaling medications plus scaling

how to confirm whether my mental issues is due to schizophrenia or anxiety,hello thank you for such a detailed history it makes things very clear I will sum up the main clinching reason why you do not have schizophrenia you have insight means you know what is wrong with you and you can attribute a reasonable logical cause to this and know where to seek help this is not the case with schizophrenics they do not have insight into the paranoia they will believe it is real this is an anxiety spectrum disorder and this over inclusive repetitive thinking can also happen in ocd obsessive compulsive disorder as well as a generalized anxiety disorder treatment for both essentially remains the same only the dosages differ a little do not worry this is not schizophrenia also do not keep in mind that schizophrenia has a higher chance of transmission from parents having an uncle with schizophrenia means you just share some genetic component keep in mind that the same gene is responsible for schizophrenia autism bipolar disorder and depression anxiety so if your uncle has schizophrenia that means you can have some sort of mental illness either something as mild as anxiety or as severe as schizophrenia please get started on sari selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or sari serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor type of medicines in addition to your therapy if you have not undergone some sessions of cut cognitive behavioral therapy please do that with a clinical psychologist since it will help you manage the symptoms of anxiety also please do deep breathing exercises daily four to five times a day when you are anxious you can do some more sessions of deep breathing until you calm down it will reduce the panicked feeling that you have,hello doctor these past few days I have been bad as I have focused back on my schizophrenia obsession it mainly focuses on times I have been paranoid or times I have visualized things as something else examples when slacking off

do not necessarily believe 100 but the possibility still causes me anxiety then the fact that they cause me anxiety causes me even more anxious after the fact wondering if these are paranoid or delusional thoughts I have talked to my therapist about these fears in the past but I may have left something out or not brought up these examples in clear enough detail she does not believe I have schizophrenia I also have talked to a psychiatrist and she told me these types of paranoid ideas may occur in anxiety or depression I am just terrified that paranoia is not a symptom of ocd and my poor vision cannot explain the minor visual imaginings not even hallucinations just premature constructions of shapes outlines and that I am not taking appropriate action to combat a much deeper mental illness my only issue with my thoughts is that they did not occur after I started fearing schizophrenia I have always had general anxiety they all have happened throughout my past after I started fearing schizophrenia I combed through my memories to try to find evidence that I am developing it and in that ruination process I picked out all the times I have had paranoid thoughts though I usually do not believe the thoughts or hold them to be true I still get anxious at what if I am hoping that is the defining characteristic that proves they are products of anxiety and ocd versus

I have knee problem with hand and shoulder stiffness could this be ra,hi I have gone through your query and blood reports I do have a few queries to help you reach the correct diagnosis I want to be really sure we are dealing with inflammatory arthritis and so we can modify your medicines accordingly as celebrex 200 would not be a solution for a long term do you experience early morning stiffness and swelling if yes for how long are these pains intermittent in nature or persistent how is the sleep pattern do you have early morning fatigue as if you did not sleep well any recent complaints of irritability and forgetfulness any persistent headaches any bowel upsets like increased frequency of stools do let me know these answers because for pain there are many reasons if inflammation is one we should act early,hello doctor I am a 28 year old female currently under investigation for ra and have been for a while now I began having knee problems at the age of 15 my mothers problems began in her knees at the age of 13 and the problems remained there for a few years in the last three to four years my symptoms have massively progressed to my hands fingers shoulders hips toes and ankles making daily chores quite painful it sounds silly but when the blood tests came back and did show inflammation I was bizarre pleased I had been made to feel like I was over exaggerating a lot so to have it proven was one step in the right direction the private doctor I saw was the one that recommended medication I take celebrex 200 my in the morning with 15 my lansoprazole as previous medication has upset my stomach this medication seemed to be working until eight months ago my blood tests showed my inflammation levels rising again recent stressful situations have I think caused quite a bad flare and I am taking paracetamol more religiously than I would usually small tasks like doing a jigsaw were causing my shoulder to ache I recently got a new set of blood tests done and the results along with results from the last 5 years have been included I would appreciate any advice you can give me I also hand scans of my knees and hips done the scans came back showing effusion in my knees I was told it is nothing to worry about at the moment as the fluid buildup is at a level that could be absorbed back in by the body if it were to get worse though I was told I would need it drained manually my hip scans came back normal but at the time of the scan my hips had only been part of the problem for maybe a year whereas my knees had been bad for the best part of 10 years I am getting frustrated with myself because of my inability to do simple tasks some days I know it is no fault of my own but that does not help when your only 28 and cannot wash the dishes or mop the floor because something will start hurting and I will have to stop I have also progressed quite badly with hand issues I have had occasions where my left wrist and hand will start shaking I have also regularly found myself dropping things like pans cups my cell phone my medication among other things my left side of my body has always been worse than my right side although my right side is slowly catching up I am unsure whether to mention my condition while looking for future work at the moment it is not preventing me from working I have had to occasionally wear braces on my knees or wrists and my current job is aware that if I am sitting down in class it is medically necessary I am aware that compared to some people my inflammation levels when looking purely at bloodwork are very low but the actual pain I am in is very real and I would very much like some advice on how to proceed primarily I am looking for a more effective way to manage my pain levels so I can get back to doing more things

how will taking birth control pills help in if,hi looking at your case history it would better to go for donor eggs ovarian reserve decreases with age and retesting for am anti mullerian is not going to affect the outcome increase ovarian reserve so no point in retesting am by taking of oral contraceptive pills continuously you cannot halt a decrease in ovarian reserve loss of eggs menses is just an indicator of loss actually a woman loses 400 600 eggs per month irrespective of whether she gets menses or not what you see on ultrasound is just loss of dominant follicle the loss of those 600 follicles cannot be seen it can be perceived indirectly by decrease in am increased requirements of hormone injections during if in vitro fertilization reduced number of eggs retrieved and low pregnancy rate one more effect of advanced age would be increased risk of down syndrome in the baby if you try with your own eggs so considering your advanced age low am poor response to stimulation low number of embryos formed in the last cycle and increased risk of down syndrome with own eggs I would suggest to go for donor eggs,hello doctor my husband and I recently underwent an if cycle and

day after the transfer I had what I can only describe as scab like discharge about the size of a tear one the sixth day I finally left the house and started to resume so level of normal activity no heavy lifting and that afternoon I had a very bright red urine flow like a small amount of blood pass when I used the bathroom I thought that it might have been implantation bleeding but clearly not I want to try if again but I am afraid of the same results in doing research I found a book that suggests many environmental factors such as bra and phthalates can play a part in egg quality quantity and affect the sperm as well the book suggests waiting three to four months prior to beginning if to get the full effect of supplements recommended as well as let the harmful chemicals leave your body my questions are given my numbers in your opinion will my number of eggs change drastically while waiting or should I be normal should I retest my am before making this decision also is there any way for me to preserve my eggs not menstruate until the month before the if procedure my thought was to take birth control pills for three months and not take the sugar pills is this safe can it be done what are the repercussion finally based on our numbers would you recommend that we use donor eggs instead of trying another cycle this time around will have to be the last as we do not have any money

I had severe pain when I tried to have sex after a gap of six months why,hi hope you are doing well from the history that you have posted I believe that you may be suffering from a dry vagina due to some reasons were you experiencing pain during cycles previously how are your periods now interval and amount of bleed normal or reduced are you breast feeding have you ever gotten pap smear done sometimes dryness may be due to allergy and anti allergic medications that probably you could have taken due to pharyngitis its necessary to involve in enough foreplay before actual penetration it helps in stimulating your genital glands to provide proper lubrication for penetration normally the walls of the vagina stay lubricated with a thin layer of clear fluid the hormone estrogen helps maintain that fluid and keeps the lining of your vagina healthy thick and elastic a drop in estrogen levels reduces the amount of moisture available it can happen at any age from a number of different causes it may seem like a minor irritation but the lack of vaginal moisture can have a huge impact on your sex life fortunately several treatments are available to relieve vaginal dryness you can use my jelly locally in and around vagina before attempting intercourse an internal injury is unlikely but please follow up with a gynaecologist if pain or bleeding is severe to get an examination done please use tab doll 650 to ease off pain and hot water bag around lower abdomen during menses to avoid cramps and the jelly I prescribed above to help reduce discomfort during intercourse since menses are heavy your estrogen levels are not sufficient so no hormone supplements needed premenstrual syndrome manifests as severe cramps sometimes and since you do not plan to get pregnant as of you can consider taking contraceptive pills it will slowly reduce the excessive cramps and will make your bleeding volume moderate hope this helps,i have a gynaecological issue my husband and I have not had intercourse for more than months a few days back when we tried to have one it hurt a lot and he withdrew he did not ejaculate inside the very next day I had a brown discharge and since then tiny blood clots ranging from red to brown have been surfacing along with light stomach cramps is this a sign of an internal injury my husband erection lasted a few seconds and he could not penetrate properly since I started to get hurt,medium severity,I had severe pain when I tried to have sex after a gap of six months why i have a gynaecological issue my husband and I have not had intercourse for more than months a few days back when we tried to have one it hurt a lot and he withdrew he did not ejaculate inside the very next day I had a brown discharge and since then tiny blood clots ranging from red to brown have been surfacing along with light stomach cramps is this a sign of an internal injury my husband erection lasted a few seconds and he could not penetrate properly since I started to get hurt,medium severity,1,i had severe pain when i tried to have sex after a gap of six months why i have a gynaecological issue my husband and i have not had intercourse for more than months a few days back when we tried to have one it hurt a lot and he withdrew he did not ejaculate inside the very next day i had a brown discharge and since then tiny blood clots ranging from red to brown have been surfacing along with light stomach cramps is this a sign of an internal injury my husband erection lasted a few seconds and he could not penetrate properly since i started to get hurt

how to know the reason for my big toe pain,hello for further information consult an orthopaedician and traumatologist online,hi doctor I have been suffering lately from pain in my big toe joint it is very severe that I could not sleep two nights when I ran out of painkillers I thought it might be a gout attack because I do have gout though my uric acid levels are mostly high I do not really watch what I eat my triggers for gouty attacks happen to be rapid weight loss it was actually the cause I had gout in the first place I lost 40 keg in a few months when I was 18 so if I count the attacks I had since the first time years ago perhaps only six times three times my right big toe and three times my left ankle all when I was not eating well and lost a lot of weight the last attack was a year ago but it has never been too severe and the most painful period will last for hours in one single night I cannot step on it and eventually it will go away gradually but this time it is too intense especially if I try to sleep I will sleep in minutes and the moment I move my toe while asleep I wake up with an extreme pain like someone stabbing my foot with a knife and cut it through from the big toe joint through the upper foot I even cried as I felt helpless with extreme pain that will not let me rest and it has been a week now and the pain is not going down with medication the moment I finished my voltaren 50 my in four days I thought it is much better now but it came back like a demon the problem is that I am confused and cannot run into all options of diagnoses due to financial situation I went today to a hospital the orthopedic was full could not get an appointment urgently so it was a general doctor he did not know for sure what is going on he suspected gout so he made blood test and uric acid was 326 umol which is the best I have ever had as he still not sure he advised to do an ray and the result he said as normal so he gave me strong painkillers and allopurinol which I did not use as my uric acid is fine and told me to see how it goes for two weeks in my ray see I noticed there is a slight difference in distance between the bones of the toes and the foot the big toe is a bit closer to the bone comparing with the other toes I do not know if this has anything to do but I want you to double check I have attached the photo taken to give you more information the pain is so intense if I am out of medication the big toe flexes up or down but up is more difficult than down and also upon stepping on it so I have to walk stepping half side of my foot avoiding landing on the big toe base of course I apply ice water almost every three hours to feel ease and also pain upon touch from the outer side of the joint to the left also you can see clear swelling and color change of the skin in the photo I am totally confused because I happen to make many mistakes that might cause different problems to my joint I am not sure which one triggered it or the cause of it I lost a lot of weight in a short period of time I was recently last month on a ketogenic diet low carbohydrate high fat in which there is a debate that it might be problem for gout sufferers I have also increased my volume and intensity of the workout due to the extra energy felt when I was veto adapted I usually stop exercising when I feel I spent a lot of hours not because I was tired so perhaps that caused a lot of stress on my body my daily workout was something like 90 minutes weight lifting in the gym and 45 minutes running and maybe 30 minutes walking to the gym if we count this as well I remember running in barefoot too I changed my shoes just a week before the pain and I chose a good quality running shoe I chose a fit one not painful or even uncomfortable but I thought because it is filled with cushioning and felt light and good I have not even known that there could be a problem until last night I read some articles against tight fit shoes especially for those with gout so I am really confused about the problem am I suffering from gout or sesamoiditis or tendinitis or turf toe I need you to guide me what should I do will I need to do an mri or it or bone scan

doppler scan shows mid left hydrocele with loose scrotum is this normal,hi I went through your detailed medical history and the reports you have mentioned here to tell you the fact a small hydrocele is usually harmless but it has the tendency to increase in size gradually over a period of time at which point you might need surgery to help you if the doppler scans are not showing the varicocele it might be at an initial stage it is a good option to get your semen analysis done this will help you to find out if there is any problem with your sperms but will not rule out the cause that is a varicocele it is advisable to get follow up doppler at three months interval but I would not recommend surgery just yet especially if you have completed a family and you already have children surgery is a necessity if your hydrocele increases in size and causes discomfort or a varicocele is found on the doppler scan of the scrotum or immediate surgery is advisable if your sperm count is low after ruling out other causes for a lower sperm count in the meantime what you can do at home is to provide scrotal support you can buy it at any pharmacy or if it is not available then you can wear tight underwear these are just temporary measures until you can get all the tests done I hope this helps,hello doctor I went for doppler scan because I feel a small tiny seed inside my scrotum sack the scan says everything is normal nothing is found testicles are fine but it says mid left hydrocoele found doctor said no need to worry and it is no cause for alarm and that I can drain it if it got bigger I went home after five days I notice a swelling that is not round in shape and close to the left testicles the urologist did another scan for scrotal doppler the report is the same as the first one only a left mid hydrocoele was found the doctor said he is surprised that the scan has not picked up varicoceles because he noticed left varicoceles when he feels it I can feel the right varicocele is small than the left varicocele he asked me to go to another hospital for a scan and mostly they should check for varicoceles surprisingly the third doppler scan for scrotal in another hospital seen nothing wrong and the investigation was normal the urologist says since the three reports have picked up nothing and no varicoceles are found he could not operate on it that this is because the varicocele is not large enough to cause problem for the doppler to see I asked the doctor whether I should go for a semen analysis to see if the semen is normal he says that is a good suggestion to rule out every suspicious of varicocele and my sperm count is normal I ask him about the swelling close to the testicles he said that is normal and I should relax and it will not affect my testicles

ca radiculopathy confirmed by egg but not in mri kindly explain,hi you do have chronic ca radiculopathy from your detailed description the reason for mismatch between nav egg findings and mri can be explained on the basis of a pre fixed or a post fixed brachial plexus where in the nerve exiting the c7 to inter space is actually carrying nerve fibres from the space below that will show up normal on mri the actual ca fibres are going out at a space above ie ca c7 or higher where they are getting compressed spur and compression exists at a higher level the second possibility is that there is arachnoiditis but that should show up on mri however I have not seen the mri myself and have to rely on the report the third explanation is possible injuries scarring at the time of acdf or after less likely as you would have known the temporal sequence of symptoms by apb you mean abductor and not abductor pollicus brevis that is median nerve appearance of new symptoms and persisting neck pain

I get bloody semen with clots and pain in my right testicle what is my problem,hello hematospermia blood in semen is fairly common generally it is not considered as a sinister sign there are whole list of possibilities for this theoretically but once we ensure it is not due to sinister cause and rule out treatable causes say like infections we do not beyond that as it will not affect the management sinister causes mainly prostate and testicular cancers at your age prostate cancer is extremely unlikely but need to ensure no testicular problem with your symptoms with tes you need another scan to be on safe side as the scope for examination to be conclusive I suspect you have epidydimal cysts which are very common and can cause pain etc so if the scan does not show anything other than this I would not worry about it at all I think the rash is completely unrelated to this or any of your urological problems nor the rash or hematospermia is related to old history of chlamydia since you have not had any other urinary symptom I would not worry much about other tests related to urinary tract however I would also recommend sending semen for culture to see any infection in it lastly about prostate cancer virtually unheard in your age finger examination of prostate spa blood test and mri scans of prostate are the screening tests in general but not something I would recommend if tes scan comes back normal and if you are still worried an mri then will be helpful as last resort idiopathic testicular pathology ultrasound scan of tes ideally an examination of genitals including prostate by a clinician semen culture idiopathic hematospermia with reports,hello doctor I am a year old male I have not had any previous health problems non smoker and non drinker

my persistent heartburn has not healed even after taking medicines for more than month why,hello you have briefly and well described your history and I understand that you have very genuine concerns so the problem you have is called gastroesophageal reflux disease herd this is basically reflux of acid from the stomach to food pipe causing heartburn sore throat sometimes cough and shortness of breath our stomach produces approximately liter of acidic juices to help digest food the acid produced does not usually come into food pipe unless someone has loose sphincter at the lower end of our food pipe which prevents acid refluxing into the food pipe there are two further classifications of herd pi responsive herd and pi refractory herd your symptoms suggest that you have pi proton pump inhibitor responsive herd since your symptoms are significantly improved when you are taking pi even in pi responsive herd the symptoms may not completely vanish but are declined to a reasonable level and this may be in your case for this you just need to increase the dose of pi instead of once daily dose you can start taking it twice a day before meals the rest of your symptoms like sore throat will go away once your acid reflux is suppressed well diet may or may not affect the herd however there are certain precautions that you can do to prevent heartburn avoiding large volume meals instead take small but frequent meals avoid taking large meals at night or before going to bed give at least three to four hours gap after night meals before going to bed for sleeping raise the head end of your bed by placing a cement or wooden block down the head side of your bed or there are commercially available anti reflux mattresses that can be used instead avoid wearing tight fitting clothes and belts so your concern about the presence of symptoms despite 42 days of treatment is valid but you see the acid is produced daily and the medicines can decrease the acid production for the duration of time they are in the blood once the level of the drug declines from a certain point the acid production takes over back so taking a daily pill to control your acid production is the only effective way of treating your condition no long term use and side effects well all pi are relatively safe and do not cause significant side effects if taken for years and years however there are studies that have shown renal damage bone protein loss and aspiration pneumonia but in practice these side effects are not that common as elaborated in studies the one daily pill to control your acid and prevailing a normal lifestyle is much more important than unforeseen and often unestablished side effects from long term use of pi I would recommend if pi helps you to do well then there is no reason for stopping for the sake of unforeseen complications but if you still have a concern about the long use of pi then I would recommend you to get oh impedance 24 hours testing to confirm herd and if present then pi again is the therapy but if the test comes out negative then pi can be stopped I hope this helps pi responsive herd ambulatory 24 hours oh impedance testing non erosive reflux disease herd tablet pantoprazole 40 my before breakfast you can increase it to 40 my bid before meals follow up if want to discuss more,hi doctor I have persistent heartburn related symptoms for the last four to five

my period is delayed by one week is it due to pregnancy or side effect of emergency pills,hello yes you are right your period will come soon and that is most likely possibility your symptoms can be due to both pregnancy and or hormones because in pregnancy there is increase in amount of hormones and you just take higher dose of hormones and symptoms you are experiencing is due to the higher level of hormones in your body which can be due to both reasons but it is more likely that symptoms are due to the pills you had taken because if it is due to pregnancy then pregnancy must be due to earlier intercourse which was protected so there are very fewer chances of failure in that case and right now your periods also get extended due to the pills you had taken basically in this situation you should do a urine pregnancy test and see if it comes positive then it is due to the failure of previous precautions and if it turns to be negative then just wait for seven more days and periods will come and even after that if your symptoms are increasing in two days then you need to go for a test for confirmation to clear the confusion drink more water and do not take much tension with your history it is more likely that it is just delayed menses due to emergency pills and side effects of oral hormones your period can be irregular for one or two cycles,hello doctor I am one week late as of today for my menstrual period currently my cycle is 38 days I have been having protected sexual intercourse the past month but just recently day 35 of my cycle the condom of my partner leaked at the base so I immediately took emergency contraceptive which is four birth control pills at am then another four birth control pills at am the following morning I started feeling the side effects but I am worried since my period is a week late already and I just woke up at am on day 38 unable to sleep with a weird feeling in my stomach and I am extremely constipated with tender breasts and feel sick overall I would like to know if my period will come soon if there is a possibility I am pregnant or if I am just feeling all these symptoms due to hormone imbalances what I should do in this whole situation since I am very worried about it,medium severity,my period is delayed by one week is it due to pregnancy or side effect of emergency pills hello doctor I am one week late as of today for my menstrual period currently my cycle is 38 days I have been having protected sexual intercourse the past month but just recently day 35 of my cycle the condom of my partner leaked at the base so I immediately took emergency contraceptive which is four birth control pills at am then another four birth control pills at am the following morning I started feeling the side effects but I am worried since my period is a week late already and I just woke up at am on day 38 unable to sleep with a weird feeling in my stomach and I am extremely constipated with tender breasts and feel sick overall I would like to know if my period will come soon if there is a possibility I am pregnant or if I am just feeling all these symptoms due to hormone imbalances what I should do in this whole situation since I am very worried about it,medium severity,1,my period is delayed by one week is it due to pregnancy or side effect of emergency pills hello doctor i am one week late as of today for my menstrual period currently my cycle is 38 days i have been having protected sexual intercourse the past month but just recently day 35 of my cycle the condom of my partner leaked at the base so i immediately took emergency contraceptive which is four birth control pills at am then another four birth control pills at am the following morning i started feeling the side effects but i am worried since my period is a week late already and i just woke up at am on day 38 unable to sleep with a weird feeling in my stomach and i am extremely constipated with tender breasts and feel sick overall i would like to know if my period will come soon if there is a possibility i am pregnant or if i am just feeling all these symptoms due to hormone imbalances what i should do in this whole situation since i am very worried about it

why do my creatinine and bun levels remain fluctuating on dialysis,hello I have worked as a chief in a hemodialysis center for 20 months once the kidneys have failed and the patient is hooked up on dialysis the creatinine value is always high at this time we do not care about the creatinine values because once we start dialysis on a patient it is assumed that his kidneys have incurred permanent damage and he cannot come back to normalcy at this juncture we use the patient creatinine value as a measure of protein intake if a dialyzing patient creatinine value is high it is assumed that he is having good protein intake through diet and high creatinine value is desirable in dialysis patients since intake of much proteins gives them a long life when creatinine value drops we start worrying that the patient is not taking much proteins so the drop in your creatinine value may be because you have started taking less proteins than usual in this situation we advise you to take more protein containing foods for a dialyzing patient the most important parameter is blood urea see what is your blood urea level before and after a single dialysis session ideally there should be a 60 reduction then it can be comfortably assumed that dialysis is effective if you do not achieve this reduction complain to the dialysis technician he will do the needful adjustments with the machine the big factor we have to afraid of is potassium it should never cross I hope this helps,hello doctor I am on dialysis for kidney failure and I have noticed a fluctuation in my monthly blood work for the creatinine and bun levels at the beginning of the year my creatinine was and it has decreased every month to I was also making more urine as I went along all of a sudden last month my creatinine jumped back up to 10 I have not changed anything in my routine or treatments does anyone have any ideas,medium severity,why do my creatinine and bun levels remain fluctuating on dialysis hello doctor I am on dialysis for kidney failure and I have noticed a fluctuation in my monthly blood work for the creatinine and bun levels at the beginning of the year my creatinine was and it has decreased every month to I was also making more urine as I went along all of a sudden last month my creatinine jumped back up to 10 I have not changed anything in my routine or treatments does anyone have any ideas,medium severity,1,why do my creatinine and bun levels remain fluctuating on dialysis hello doctor i am on dialysis for kidney failure and i have noticed a fluctuation in my monthly blood work for the creatinine and bun levels at the beginning of the year my creatinine was and it has decreased every month to i was also making more urine as i went along all of a sudden last month my creatinine jumped back up to 10 i have not changed anything in my routine or treatments does anyone have any ideas

are there any medications to reduce my long term tinnitus problem,hello your tinnitus problem could be due to sinusitis which blocks the eustachian tube and causes tinnitus but if the tinnitus is due to sinus problem it should subside with decongestant etc in your case I do not think so that your ear problem is due to sinusitis to rule out that we need to get audiometry and tympanometry done also let me know if you are on any medication or if you are exposed to loud sounds I do not support multivitamin supplements for tinnitus but you can take any of them for a month and see if symptom improves then you can take for a longer time but again we will need an audiometry test for recurrent sinusitis you should get a nasal endoscopy done if needed it computed tomography scan of nose and paranasal sinuses also only then we will know the severity of the disease,hi doctor I have had tinnitus for five to seven years now I had suffered a lot during the initial years as there was no

are bulging discs the worst symptom of fibromyalgia,hi I have read through your query in detail please find my observations below fibromyalgia is still a less understood illness with pain and discomfort involving muscles and bones and the main feature includes that it is puzzling or difficult to identify it is elusive and is a diagnosis the diagnosis is made on the elimination of known conditions which might cause similar symptoms after using standard diagnostic tests and investigations therefore if a patient is known to have bulging discs then it has to differ from fibromyalgia in other words you might have had fibromyalgia if there is no particular finding in the mri magnetic resonance imaging scan therefore it is important to document mri scan findings and then the diagnosis of fibromyalgia might be set aside and changed to include degenerative disc disease following the proof of bulging discs the problem is that probably earlier investigations have led your employers to believe that you have fibromyalgia however a single incident has changed things for you and they refuse to accept it the best way out will be to have evidence based medical diagnosis and take suggested treatment I agree that there is a lot of miscommunication about fibromyalgia and people with real problems are often labeled wrongly considering an earlier diagnosis which was made months to years back in conclusion fibromyalgia is not concerned with bulging discs and if your mri scan shows bulging discs which might be related to your pain and discomfort symptoms then you have the option of making a point with the workman comp authority hope this answers your question,hello doctor I just want to confirm with you that fibromyalgia does not cause bulging discs my workman company blamed my fibromyalgia for disc bulging because in the past I have had headaches and neck pain with my fibre the bulging disc pain was within three hours numb hurting tingling arm all the way down after helping a coworker shovel and then running a big vibrating roller it was different than bursitis I have ever experienced I developed a headache after the pain in my arm calmed down the headache was in the front left of my forehead definitely not a tension fibre headache I also have occipital neuralgia that came with the fibre in the back of my scalp after hearing that it can happen while doing anything was when I came to the conclusion that is the only thing I did differently that day I feel like no matter what happens to me the fibromyalgia will get the blame after researching degenerative disc disease almost everyone has it I do not think this is a well known fact it happens as you age and can be as early as your teens and 20 people also want to blame things on that as a pre existing condition yet if they had an mri they would have it too otherwise my spine is beautiful according to my doctor I am 51 years old and was a heavy equipment operator and a pa for my aunt at the same time while having three teenagers at home the fibromyalgia and stress is really getting to me now though and I am having a tough time even working eight hours a week as a pa just so tired and fed up with misconceptions and lack of doctor and public awareness I hope this post and your answer will help other fibromyalgia patients because I know I am not the only one dealing with this,medium

am I getting facial tightness because of anxiety,hello I read carefully your question and would agree with your doctor on the fact that all your symptoms are suggestive of anxiety the fact that your symptoms are relieved by lying down alcohol or physical activity is another argument in favour of anxiety anyways before coming to this conclusion I would recommend checking vitamin plasma levels for possible deficiency and blood pressure for possible imbalances it is also necessary performing a cervical spine ray study in order to exclude any possible bulging disc in the cervical vertebral column which could lead to burning sensation in the neck and shoulders in the meantime I would recommend taking magnesium supplements to help relieve the muscle spasm,hi doctor I am a 25 year old male I do not have any medical history been always healthy for the past months I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity the facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed the tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right at times I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face as of recent I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well prior to this facial tightness I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month it was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related went for rays and echo heart ultrasound everything came out fine I have a

doctors even the neuro specialist and they all said it was anxiety the doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is I have no troubles at all I did blood test it came out normal they told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from even though the facial tightness was there I tried my utmost best to ignore it I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation however it has been whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above in all honesty I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it is less however it is always there even as when I am typing this

sometimes diet nutrition laboratory variation etc I would advise you not to worry and just get a routine laboratory check as per your primary physician like months or so you completely recovered the only advice is to make sure when you start any new drug or take ot drugs herbal medications make sure they do not have side effects of bone marrow suppression so just be cautious rest you are doing good please text me any other concerns if you have,hello doctor I am 40 years old 20 years back I was diagnosed with severe aplastic anemia idiopathic which was treated with at with prednisone cyclosporine it took a good year to have a complete recovery but it came back to 100 I have always lived a bit in the fear of myelodysplasia but 23 years later no issues other than cholesterol and high blood pressure I am being follow by a family doctor and getting blood counts every month but my last hematologist consultation was a very long time ago and while my doctor is fantastic I know that knowledge of hematology is complex I am tracking by blood counts for the last 12 years in the last years I develop my own concerns around some numbers that seems to trend on lower side first is erythrocyte which are 3 now 13 years back I was consistently around 8 but my last blood count was 3 but after years it has never been above 5 I do not know if this is significant or not but I know that our reference is 7 of the lower value average 13 bloods test would be 53 my hemoglobin is at 132 now my average would be 141 so the difference is not high but I still wonder about if it is significant finally hematocrit at 4 right under the low level it would average out a 41 now a new contender appeared in the outside of normal ranges and its the granulocytes immature at 04 reference is 03 10e9 platelet are doing great with 183 so no challenges here so in a way all of these number are very close to the lower normal I guess I am trying to figure out if I should investigate this

I have pain in my lower left back tooth and medicines are not helping me why,hello I have gone through your query and understood your concern unfortunately taking medicines is not a permanent solution to dental pain there are several factors that cause dental pain and associated headache the most common cause is tooth decay however a clear clinical picture or an ray will help determine what is causing your pain when decay reaches the nerve of the tooth it starts to give out symptoms the nerve which supplies the tooth also supplies that side of the face hence the referred associated pain taking painkillers will help control the pain to some extent but it does nothing to cure the decay it can only be manually treated by removing them you may require an ray procedure to determine the extent of the decay and if the nerve of the tooth is involved a root canal treatment is generally done to remove infections and decay since it is the time of the pandemic dentists are providing emergency care only and some dentists prefer telephonic consultation prior to dental visit and treatment if the pain is unbearable even after taking medicines it is best to call up a dentist providing emergency care and get it treated I hope this helps,hello doctor I have a problem with the second last toothache of left side lower jaw and also headache what can be the problem and the medicine used by me does not give me any relief mom 500 limcee oxalgin twice daily for three days then the other dentists suggested me these medicine ordent seradic pan dsr but also no permanent relief from toothache and headaches what can be the problem and solution,low severity,I have pain in my lower left back tooth and medicines are not helping me why hello doctor I have a problem with the second last toothache of left side lower jaw and also headache what can be the problem and the medicine used by me does not give me any relief mom 500 limcee oxalgin twice daily for three days then the other dentists suggested me these medicine ordent seradic pan dsr but also no permanent relief from toothache and headaches what can be the problem and solution,low severity,0,i have pain in my lower left back tooth and medicines are not helping me why hello doctor i have a problem with the second last toothache of left side lower jaw and also headache what can be the problem and the medicine used by me does not give me any relief mom 500 limcee oxalgin twice daily for three days then the other dentists suggested me these medicine ordent seradic pan dsr but also no permanent relief from toothache and headaches what can be the problem and solution
