reports to a paediatrician online,hi doctor my 18 month old daughter has had problems since birth and I am desperate for a second opinion the history is complicated trying to explain the symptoms but I will do my best it was detected polyhydramnios in pregnancy my daughter born at 36 weeks days through emergency section due to pre eclampsia her weight was 3070g no tube passed three times due to polyhydramnios we went home on day two readmitted on day five for phototherapy till months of age several visits with health visitor and go for colic like symptoms and constipation she will scream in pain which opening her bowel and only opening her bowels every four to five days over this time they tried colief infacol lactulose glycerin suppositories ranitidine gaviscon and domperidone nine different formulas and we also tried all common natural remedies for reflux like keeping upright after feeding etc no alleviation of symptoms at all with exception of glycerin suppositories which did seem to help the constipation in months pediatric consultant suggests functional constipation and recommends higher dose of lactulose and movicol for 16 weeks he suggested that we are giving her too many glycerin suppositories and that is making her dependent on glycerin to open her bowels and so glycerin was stopped we delayed weaning whilst waiting for appointment at this point her symptoms completely changed to intermittent diarrhea and constipation bowel frequency increased to once a day colic like pain and she does not start vomiting until the consistency of the food moves up to a more solid consistency the laxatives made absolutely no difference in her 10 months of age the constipation has turned to diarrhea the doctor is happy that it was functional constipation and discharged her at months she had first acute episode of chronic diarrhea and forceful vomiting lasted for 16 days which coincides with the introduction of cow milk during 14 months of age she was introduced to solid food chronic forceful vomiting which does not seem to follow any pattern a food diary is followed for several weeks and there does not seem to be any consistent non ice allergy as a cause during her 14 months of age we had an appointment with dietician and switched from normal formula to pepsi and then neocate her chronic wheeze disappears overnight but chronic vomiting continues she troubleshoot overfeeding as a cause we are feeding her more as she is vomiting when we did not substitute the feeds she lost weight so if she vomited a feed we gave her another one hour later we fed her small quantities throughout the day to try and prevent vomiting again in 15 months consulted her dietician and he suggested definite non ice cow milk protein allergy and to try trial and error with other three common allergies soy wheat and dairy so then for a month we followed strict elimination of those three this month she had only neocate liquid diet plus corn snacks organix and one paella meal symptoms improved but sporadic forceful vomiting remains she tolerated only one baby paella meal well which is overcooked rice very mushy consistency now again we attempted to challenge the three foods back in and move beyond this one meal all attempts were failed her reaction to us seems to be much more about the consistency of the food rather than what the food is she can tolerate a large amount of breadcrumbs but cannot tolerate a piece of toast we continue with food diary and there really is no clear pattern which isolates one food again in her 17 months age when we consulted her dietician he was unsure whether the symptoms fit flies at all and suggests gastro referral then she had second acute episode we went a and on day five and was sent home with suggestion of gastroenteritis chronic vomiting and diarrhea lasted 15 days she lost 10 of her body weight sent home on neocate as the only diet but there is no evidence of gagging choking or problem swallowing no fussing or wriggling during feeding four months back her weight was 12 keg and now 10 keg her barium ray showed mild malrotation but at met it was decided this was not explanation of symptoms we have recently tried omeprazole to rule out severe reflux and it made no change genetic blood tests kidney and abdominal ultrasound were normal for us her symptoms now are identical to what they were like before the onset of weaning again she is suffering from intermittent colic pain and constipation but there is no vomiting she is not sleeping well at all we have increased her water intake and added lactulose and the stools are no longer hard but she still seems uncomfortable stools are very dark green we have tried a couple of solids she prefers crunchy food she tolerates corn based crisps as they basically dissolve into crumbs into your mouth we tried peas grapes and she passed all of the peas grapes and beans completely undigested in her feces without solids she does not sleep well at all because the neocate just does not fill her up for long enough and so she is screaming all night because she is hungry so we tried a few solids and she is still screaming half the night with colic like pain she is clearly in pain because she is absolutely screaming she is pretty inconsolable but the only thing that does relieve it is sucking on something like a bottle of water she is waking up about every 20 to 30 minutes throughout the night during the day she still has this colic like symptoms and she is tired and clingy and uninterested in playing she does tend to have one to two hours a

pelvic ultrasound suggest endometriosis and adenomyosis will they cause infertility in long run,hello welcome to iclniq com I have read your query both problems more or less will have the same effect in the long run it might affect you getting pregnant but if you get pregnant then symptoms of endometriosis subsided may be for ever it does not have any effects on pregnancy and baby no risk of preterm delivery or anything the permanent solution for this condition is the removal of uterus and ovary but not recommended if you have plans for further pregnancy of oral contraceptive pills can help you in disease suppression some gnrh gonadotropin releasing hormone injection are also available but they have side effects so not recommend for long term of pills can be taken for years if you miss of pills for two to three months or so then endometriosis should not return back immediately so any time if you want to stop it for a few months definitely you can do that talking about the sharp pelvic pain it could be because of fibrosis after cesarean section you can do some moderate exercise on a daily basis which can help you there are no specific dietary things which can help,hello doctor I am a 32 year old female I had my second baby via section a couple of months after I started getting pelvic pain the pain is across my whole pelvic area and lower back and some times in my thighs too very similar to menstrual cramps occasionally I would get a sharp pain on either side of my pelvic area especially on the right side I also get pelvic cramps every time after sexual intercourse and occasional pain when I go to the toilet the pain is bearable and when it gets a little worse I can manage it by taking pain killers I get the pain almost every single day as well not just when I am on my period my periods have always been very heavy and painful from the beginning but have been able to keep it under control by taking the combined contraceptive pill gedarel 30 150 my and mefenamic acid which I have been taking for many years I have also been getting headaches and I am always very tired due to the lack of sleep I get from these pains during the night half the time I feel very stressed out because of the way I am feeling and it is not easy being a mom of two young children as well and having to manage with the pains etc I eventually visited the go and had some tests done such as smear tests infection swabs blood tests and an ultrasound scan everything was normal but the transvaginal ultrasound showed I have endometriosis and adenomyosis I was referred to a specialist gynecologist and although he has given me a course of action to follow for the next six months I felt that the appointment was a bit rushed and I had a lot of questions to ask regarding the two conditions I would really like to ask a few questions regarding the conditions as soon as possible because my next appointment is not for another six months and there are a few things I would like to know about how these two conditions will affect me in the long run I just need some answers for peace of mind nothing specific to me but more about the disease itself the doctor has advised to take the combined contraceptive pill for another six months without a break and to take pain killers as and when required the consultant also mentioned progesterone based methods but we had to rule that out as it causes hair loss and I have been through years of a form of alopecia and have just managed to get my hair back I have tried asking doctors online and have been conned by them because they have taken money from me and just copied and pasted answers from other places online which made me quite upset and furious hopefully someone from here can give me proper and professional answers these are the following questions I would like to ask what causes these two conditions I am aware that these two conditions cannot be 100 diagnosed via imaging methods and laparoscopy is the only method that provides a definitive diagnosis so how can a clinician be sure that they are treating me for the right condition and it is not something worse how will these conditions affect me in the long run if they begin the progress which out of the two endometriosis or adenomyosis is more severe and serious how will they affect my fertility and what would happen if I wanted to have another baby in the future will it be hard to get pregnant will it cause problems to either me or the baby is there an increased risk of miscarriages and preterm labor and if so how likely is this what if I were to come off the pill for whatever reason how can I manage these conditions are there any other methods or a form of lifestyle I can follow to help such as certain dietary intakes etc how can I prevent getting pain when I go to the toilet mainly passing stool and help with sleep any other information will be greatly appreciated also are there any online groups or

kindly explain about the best medication for major depression from sari group,hello firstly sir it is just a brief labelling to broadly differentiate classes but many people who do not respond to one sari will do well with another drug of the same class so cross switching between classes is also done among the sari my personal experience as well as the literature supports the use of venlafaxine as superior compared to others lets assume that we are going to use venlafaxine as a primary drug in non responders or resistant usually augmenting agents are given I do not know what agents have been tried for your son so far but normally sari with mood stabilizer like sodium valproate or lithium or sari low dose second generation antipsychotic or sari plus combinations of mood stabilizer and low dose antipsychotics can be used apart from this other classes of drugs can also help such as mirtazepine bupropion and as and when needed temporary use of low dose benzodiazipines and propranolol can also be added the goal here will be remission of symptoms or atleast reduction to an acceptable level in patients with resistance usually or drug combinations will be needed also many psychiatrists do not reach the maximal dosage recommended of most drugs and that also needs to be tried out apart from this you should consider getting to sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy from a clinical psychologist it will also help and add to the effect of medicines,hello doctor I need help for my 19 year old son he has tried sari which did not work then we had the gene testing done and it showed

I have a mild tender lump under the skin of the deltoid muscle is that sarcoma,hi I can understand the anxiety you would be suffering from after suspecting that it is a sarcoma here is what I can suggest to you sarcoma is an uncommon cause of such lumps and much more common are some harmless cysts and lipomas malignant tumors like sarcoma generally do not stay the same size for three years most malignant sarcoma in limbs are not associated with pain however there is only one way to find out for sure and that is doing some tests on this lump you have not mentioned the size of the lump if it is small for about 2 am in diameter then it may be possible to take it out and test for malignant cells thoroughly if it is larger then an mri scan and a needle core biopsy can be done to decide the treatment whether it can directly be taken out or not will be decided by the size and exact location of the lump please send a picture with a scale measure by the side of the lump if you want to follow up much more commonly however it is a cyst that can be easily taken out without any ill effects to know if it is a cyst or not your doctor needs to examine you and maybe do an ray of the limb and an ultrasound examination of the site but only if required for now do not worry just see a good surgeon most likely it is a lipoma or a cyst and not a tumor,hi doctor I am having a mild tender bump or a lump or a kind of knot deep under the skin on the deltoid muscle it is very hard to tell if it is moving under the skin it has been there for three years I have not noticed any significant growth in the last three years I am quite scared after reading about sarcomas I am 20 years old please help,medium severity,I have a mild tender lump under the skin of the deltoid muscle is that sarcoma hi doctor I am having a mild tender bump or a lump or a kind of knot deep under the skin on the deltoid muscle it is very hard to tell if it is moving under the skin it has been there for three years I have not noticed any significant growth in the last three years I am quite scared after reading about sarcomas I am 20 years old please help,medium severity,1,i have a mild tender lump under the skin of the deltoid muscle is that sarcoma hi doctor i am having a mild tender bump or a lump or a kind of knot deep under the skin on the deltoid muscle it is very hard to tell if it is moving under the skin it has been there for three years i have not noticed any significant growth in the last three years i am quite scared after reading about sarcomas i am 20 years old please help

I am on medication for fibroid and getting on and off bleeding is this the side effect of medication,hello welcome to icliniq com it would have been helpful if you could attach the report of your ultrasound for me to have a look based on what you mentioned about the total size of two fibroid to be am I am assuming each one must be less than am and not so huge fibroid would not cause irregular bleeding unless they are lying close to the uterine cavity usually in the perimenopausal age group of women like you are already 48 we prefer to give medical management so as to control the bleeding in those who have excess bleeding as with age your menopause may set in and menses will eventually stop and then you will not have any problems because of the fibroid this is done to avoid unnecessary surgery when the bleeding would anyways stop after menopause in your case I would like to know if the fibroid are close to the uterine cavity on ultrasound which may cause irregular bleeding also in your query the drug name has not come but I guess it is tranexamic acid or tragic or pause which just controls the excessive bleeding means will reduce the bleeding but will neither stop the bleeding pattern due to hormonal disturbance in the perimenopausal abnormal bleeding nor due to the fibroid which bleed due to the close situation to the uterine cavity other causes if irregular bleeding apart from fibroid need to be evaluated like hormonal changes thyearoid issues or uterine lining endometrial thickening etc if it is due to fibroid position that is causing off and on bleeding it may not stop with tragic but only will reduce in amount and may stop only after menopause or after the surgical removal of the uterus but if it is due to the hormonal disturbance or due to the perimenopausal phase it needs to be controlled with some hormonal medications it would be good if you could connect with me through chat and share the reports of yours so that we can have a close look if any further evaluation needs to be done regarding the abnormal bleeding pattern ultrasound report needs to be reviewed thyearoid abnormalities perimenopausal rub abnormal uterine bleeding ca cancer endometrium ein endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia please revert back with reports,hello doctor I am 48 years old I have two fibroid am total size and was advised to take 500 my three times a day but it completely stops the bleeding but the bleeding starts after three days again I have had on and off bleeding for two weeks now is this a common problem with the medication I am extremely worried and cannot be normal please help and advise,medium severity,I am on medication for fibroid and getting on and off bleeding is this the side effect of medication hello doctor I am 48 years old I have two fibroid am total size and was advised to take 500 my three times a day but it completely stops the bleeding but the bleeding starts after three days again I have had on and off bleeding for two weeks now is this a common problem with the medication I am extremely worried and cannot be normal please help and advise,medium severity,1,i am on medication for fibroid and getting on and off bleeding is this the side effect of medication hello doctor i am 48 years old i have two fibroid am total size and was advised to take 500 my three times a day but it completely stops the bleeding but the bleeding starts after three days again i have had on and off bleeding for two weeks now is this a common problem with the medication i am extremely worried and cannot be normal please help and advise

swabbed for mesa in my nose and butt before both surgeries and was told I did not have it for the last day of my stay I had a roommate who had a bad mesa infection on her butt and sometimes had diarrhea incontinence during dressing changes I had no physical contact with her but we had the same nurse I was discharged with a five day course of augmenting the wound has been healing very well and has not gotten infected but three weeks after discharge I got an abscess under my arm I went to an urgent care and was prescribed clindamycin and told to return in three days for drainage the abscess did not improve or get worse over the three days I got it drained and was prescribed augmenting and told to also continue the clindamycin that was a week ago and the wound is healing well they called today and said cultures show it was mesa and they prescribed bactrim and told me to stop the other antibiotics I am feeling devastated by this and wanting to understand why it happened could I have gotten it in the hospital I am concerned that it will not go away are those swabs at the hospital conclusive and mean for sure I did not have mesa a month ago I have never had any medical

what is the pregnancy possibility with precum,hello I do not think you have to worry about this let me explain each one by one if periods are irregular you can never predict when ovulation is it is always 14 days before the periods so even if it is day cycle ovulation will be on the third or fourth day life of egg is only 24 hours then it dies emergency contraceptive is very effective if taken early earlier the better so even if the ovulation has occurred pills will not allow the pregnancy to settle dryness in the vagina could be due to lack of lubrication caused by any infection anxiety or due to hormones in the pills even if you did not have good foreplay her vagina will be dry being a virgin she is prone to have abarations or scratches in the vagina in the first act of sex it will resolve on its own seminal fluid is the clear white fluid before semen ejaculation it contains a high concentration of sperms it need not enter the vagina even if semen falls on the thighs it can swim up because of chemical attraction this fluid is formed only when you have the sexual arousal or touch sensation from the partner it is always better to have safe sex with a condom to avoid all these

can schizophrenia be inherited and pass down to next generation,hello based on the history provided I see that you do not have any first degree relatives with schizophrenia so the risk is not high this condition can run in families but the risk is more when you have first degree relatives with schizophrenia like parents siblings schizophrenia is relatively rare affecting about of the general population so anyone in the world has a in 100 chance of developing schizophrenia your risk will be the same as the general population possibly marginally higher due to extended family history you need not worry unnecessarily as the risk is not substantially higher than anybody else in the world to give you an idea about the genetic risk of schizophrenia look at these figures if there is a first degree relative with schizophrenia the risk increases to 10 if both parents have schizophrenia the risk increases to 50 if there is identical twin the risk can increase to about 50 to 65 you do not fall into these categories you may be aware that genes play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia but they alone are not responsible schizophrenia is caused by a complex interaction between genes environment and psychological factors environmental factors like illicit drug use and high stress levels play a huge role since there is a possible history of schizophrenia in the extended family it makes sense to avoid any risk factors like illicit drugs use weed cocaine etc continue an active and healthy lifestyle continue appropriate treatment for depression anxiety and ocd obsessive compulsive disorder if you have any other concerns you can contact your psychiatrist for a review I hope this helps,hello doctor I am a 28 year old male in good health I have suffered bouts of depression for the past few years along with anxiety and ocd I am on zoloft every day and am doing well for the most part I am staying active and keeping busy the reason why I ask this is that on my mother side there are two stories of people with suspected schizophrenia my maternal grandmother mother was said to have been institutionalized for her life because of it and my maternal aunt mom sister is a paranoid schizophrenic according to my grandma does this skip generations neither of my parents or siblings has this condition what are the chances of becoming a schizophrenic do I have anything to worry about,medium severity,can schizophrenia be inherited and pass down to next generation hello doctor I am a 28 year old male in good health I have suffered bouts of depression for the past few years along with anxiety and ocd I am on zoloft every day and am doing well for the most part I am staying active and keeping busy the reason why I ask this is that on my mother side there are two stories of people with suspected schizophrenia my maternal grandmother mother was said to have been institutionalized for her life because of it and my maternal aunt mom sister is a paranoid schizophrenic according to my grandma does this skip generations neither of my parents or siblings has this condition what are the chances of becoming a schizophrenic do I have anything to worry about,medium severity,1,can schizophrenia be inherited and pass down to next generation hello doctor i am a 28 year old male in good health i have suffered bouts of depression for the past few years along with anxiety and ocd i am on zoloft every day and am doing well for the most part i am staying active and keeping busy the reason why i ask this is that on my mother side there are two stories of people with suspected schizophrenia my maternal grandmother mother was said to have been institutionalized for her life because of it and my maternal aunt mom sister is a paranoid schizophrenic according to my grandma does this skip generations neither of my parents or siblings has this condition what are the chances of becoming a schizophrenic do i have anything to worry about

what is the relation between lead poisoning and heart problems,hello it saddens me to hear of the whole difficulties you have gone through in the past years I must recommend you for staying strong in the face of all these difficulties I have thoroughly gone through all your detailed explanation and here is my view although I have not had clinical experience of a patient with such complications I have thoroughly researched to find enough evidence to bring me to the conclusion that lead poisoning can lead to heart diseases and stroke but no much evidence of asbestos causing cardiovascular diseases these below are my findings in a study that involved 60 participants it was concluded that lead poisoning was associated with cardiovascular events most commonly but not limited to hypertension especially in lead blood levels below dl another article also detailed the complications of lead poisoning to the cardiovascular system although the mechanism is unknown a study by the harvard school of public health hsph also detailed the effects of bone lead to increase cardiovascular complications in my conclusion there is more than 50 chance of a cardiovascular complication due to lead poisoning although they might argue the fact that only a few cases have been reported I feel strongly that more than 50 of it caused your heart complications your level of lead exposure will help your case,hello doctor I am 42 years old I had a heart attack 12 years ago and now have three stents by the way I have no family history of heart disease high blood pressure cholesterol and

why am I not able to hear clearly without hearing aid though my hearing is within range,hi let me tell you a statement which explains it perfectly the ear receives the sound but interpretation of sound happens at the brain so many a times with mild hearing loss speech perception is low moreover you have tinnitus too I hope you have fitted with digital programmable computerized programmable hearing aids if yes it amplifies exactly the same as required in each frequency no need to worry about it by the way avoid caffeinated drinks tea coffee alcohol and avoid noisy situations as much as possible puretone is used in the test in which you got the result mild mid frequency hearing loss pure tone audiometry but in day to day life you are not listening to pure tones right it is speech so pure tone audiometry and speech audiometry should be done and correlated if that would have been done then you must have a clear picture of your problem my honest suggestion is to use the hearing aids so as not to worsen the condition if you stop using it that may cause further deterioration,hello doctor I am a man in my early twenties that started using hearing aids about a year ago I am very happy with this it has really changed my life just recently I started reading up a bit more and now I feel very confused and weird about it all the thing is I was told I had a mild mid frequency hearing loss when I actually look at my audiometry test it shows that as well but my hearing is barely within the range of being considered a hearing loss reading around I found out that most people with such a mild loss can mostly hear fine and do not need hearing aids when I read about what my hearing loss is supposed to be like I do not relate I relate way more to the explanations of what moderate hearing loss sounds and feel like and hearing aids help me a lot when I do not wear my hearing aids it sounds to me like listening to people talking through a door I rely a lot on lip reading if I cannot wear my hearing aids phone conversations were almost impossible before I got them I just cannot make my hearing loss make sense with my actual experience with hearing so I have been wondering what causes me to feel like I hear so bad when my hearing is just slightly below the normal range I should say that I have tinnitus as well sometimes quite a lot so that maybe factors into it too recently I began to wonder whether the reason I hear so much worse compared to other people with my level of hearing loss is that I have add and ptsd which makes it so hard to focus do you think this is a possibility or could it simply be that I handle my hearing loss worse than others I just do not understand why I experience hearing speech as so difficult and why I am so dependent on hearing aids when my hearing loss is technically very mild,medium severity,why am I not able to hear clearly without hearing aid though my hearing is within range hello doctor I am a man in my early

how to fix the problem of repeated collection of fluid in ears,hello thanks for the detailed history I can understand that you have gone through a lot because of your repeated ear issues very clearly none of the conditions you have either fluid in middle ear or hole in the eardrum are painful conditions surgery for these conditions is done mainly to improve hearing repeated collection of fluid in the middle ear can occur due to various reasons such as eustachian tube dysfunction adenoids allergy etc the most common being eustachian tube dysfunction now coming to the treatment of your condition you can continue flonase nasal spray for a few months and see if there is any improvement in fluid in the middle ear if that is not working then the next option would be to undergo balloon dilatation of eustachian tubes which may work sometimes last option would be the insertion of grommet again but an operated ear grommet can cause permanent perforation and you have to live with it all your life as far as pain is concerned it is probably due to taj dysfunction as you said prozac worsens bruxism and you may need to stop it with your symptoms or doctor consent these chronic conditions such as eustachian tube dysfunction are difficult to treat and eustachian tube balloon dilatation may be a good choice for you as you are a frequent flyer,hi doctor I have a history of ear problems seven surgeries as of right now I had tubes placed in both ears when I was younger and more recent before few years after the tubes were removed both ear drums were left with holes in them which have been closed with surgery in the left ear there was only one tympanoplasty done as for the right ear there was a fat plug done and failed next there was a tympanoplasty which also failed finally a neurotologist preformed another tympanoplasty with cartilage back up and it has taken within the last three months I have had fluid in the left ear twice and prednisone has been used once I was flying and caused barotrauma from being sick and flying the other was just fluid sitting there which is still there after 12 days of prednisone also I have been told to take amoxicillin three times the last three months only I did it with the barotrauma as there was blood sitting behind the ear now I have got three different opinions from ent doctors and still I am confused as to what to try the normal ent that has done all but the last surgery where he made me go elsewhere because he was not comfortable trying again and said the hearing in my right ear has gotten worse from the last hearing test I do not have a copy of the most recent hearing test he wants to put a hole in the right ear the neurotologist was for putting a tube in the right after surgery as there was fluid behind the ear drum but he has left the country so my choices are limited to go back to him I have been traveling back and forth 12 hours each way for the last few months and driving after the barotrauma is getting pain in the left ear now the second doctor opinion he said that he would not recommend tubes as both ear drums are intact he recommended for an allergy test if it helps at all I have been using flonase as well continuously all three doctors said to do it the third doctor told me he would leave the right ear alone and recommended a tube in my left ear with my travel schedule he basically said I need to determine if I want to live with holes or leave them intact and have pain when it comes on also I have been diagnosed with taj after the first tube surgery which I think that lead to the pain that made me go through with the tubes in the first place I have had treatment for that I hit all the limits I could with my dentist and am now having a day time splint made all the problems in the left ear have started since three months back I was placed on prozac by a doctor which is known for making clenching worse I have done the botox in the masseter for taj which has helped in the past and we

I am type diabetic and my sugar shoots after wheat and carb intake why,hello welcome to icliniq com I will provide you the outline of management in your case however actual changes in treatment regimen should be done after discussing with treating doctor firstly your heart looks alright with no evidence of blockages however blood pressure is an issue which needs to be taken care of you are started on ramipril but you should check it frequently at home as 5 my alone less likely to completely normalize your be so if home be remains elevated more than 140 90 mhg after 5 my ramipril then it has to make twice daily next regarding sugar it is not very well controlled especially post meals now I do not know whether you were tried initially on any medications or not if not then medications should be tried now metformin is a basic and most important medication for it so you should discuss with your doctor regarding initiating it also you will need add on drugs as metformin alone will not be sufficient which includes teneliglipitin and glimepiride which comes in combination of metformin if medications are not feasible at the moment then dose of bolus insulin which is delivered with each meals should be increased by two units in order to take care of post meals surge so that you are able to have proper diet also regarding pains it is likely a neuropathy due to deranged sugars for that sugars should be tightly controlled and you will need supplements like neurobion forte once daily if this does respond to multivitamin supplements then you will need nerve stabilizers like pregabalin etc also your triglycerides level is too much elevated for that you need to have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty oily foods have regular exercises like brisk walking for at least 30 minutes a day this will also bring your sugar level down also you will need medications here to control triglycerides like tablet fenofibrate 145 my bedtime daily for eight weeks there are some issues and there is good scope for improvement also you should undergo tit treadmill test at regular intervals of three to four years also considering your family history of heart disease it is better you also undergo it computed tomography coronary angiography once as it has got very high sensitivity and can tell us if even minute blockages and preventive medications can be started I hope this

can an old man with partially injured cervical spinal cord able to walk without assistance,hello I read carefully your question and would explain that the cervical spinal cord is a very delicate part of the spinal cord because in its beginning are located the most important centers which control the heart rate the pulmonary function and the blood pressure values it is true that just after a trauma a man can walk with or without assistance for 50 meters and this can sound strange in fact this can be related to the lack of damage to the spinal cord in that moment there is only the fracture of the vertebral column while the central nervous system is intact while walking the instability of the damaged vertebral column causes further damage to the spinal cord and the person gets paralyzed regarding the partial and complete damage of the spinal cord it is difficult to judge all the damages begin as partial but because of the spinal cord instability the lack of right immobilization and the bleeding and swelling the damage may become complete in the next days the swelling and bleeding tend to spread and the spinal cord is trapped within the vertebral column and can not expand further so the swelling and bleeding cause further damage to the spinal cord it is difficult to judge in the first days of trauma but because of the swelling in the first days after the trauma first week the person may die because of acute cardio respiratory arrest due to the dysfunction of the heart and respiratory function the swelling tends to spread in the upper cord and the paralysis becomes complete affecting also the respiration and the heart rhythm I hope this helps,hi doctor I have some questions I would like answered on cervical spinal cord injuries please if a person only had a partial transection of the cervical spinal cord would their final outcome still be a complete cervical spinal cord injury where they no mobility or sensory function or is it possible their final outcome could be an incomplete cervical spinal cord injury where they have some mobility and sensory function can a person with a neck fracture die from their cervical spinal cord being compressed because of bleeding and swelling from the fracture compressing against the cord can a person with an incomplete cervical spinal cord injury caused by a traumatic accident die four days after the accident because of the cervical spinal cord failure to control blood pressure and heart rate or respiratory failure because of damage done to the cord or would they have to have a complete cervical spinal cord injury to die four days after the accident because of the same reason stated above and lastly would it be possible for a elderly male aged 80 who has had a fall and has either a partially severed his cervical spinal cord or his cervical spinal cord been injured by being compressed from bleeding and swelling as result of a neck fracture be physically able to walk roughly 50 meters with someone assisting him if it is possible what would their balance be like for example if the person assisting the injured man was holding him with one their arms holding him at the waist would be able to walk

will it scan help in determining the malignancy status of an enlarged lymph node,hi it is a structural imaging method that relies on assessment of lymphnodes lens based on their anatomy viz size shape margins and enhancement patterns among these size is still the most common criterion a short axis diameter of more than am is generally accepted as a threshold for malignancy in most studies however the diagnostic sensitivity of this standard is weakened by the fact that many a times malignant lens can be normal in size false negative and many invective nodes can be enlarged in size thus giving false positive results on imaging nowadays it is combined with pet positron emission tomography to get both anatomical and functional information it is called fusion imaging and is mainly used to diagnose and stage metastatic cancers such as lymphomas it also uses ionizing radiation rays that is another disadvantage which needs to be considered so to sum it all structural imaging methods such as ultrasound it conventional mri do not distinguish benign lens from malignant ones with 100 accuracy conversely functional imaging methods such as dwi diffusion weighted pet have low spatial resolution and are time consuming therefore now we are seeing a shift towards fusion imaging techniques such as dwi t2w1 mri pet it etc as these techniques bypass the above mentioned shortcomings,hello doctor is there anyway that a it scan can determine whether an enlarged lymph node is benign or malignant,medium severity,will it scan help in determining the malignancy status of an enlarged lymph node hello doctor is there anyway that a it scan can determine whether an enlarged lymph node is benign or malignant,medium severity,1,will it scan help in determining the malignancy status of an enlarged lymph node hello doctor is there anyway that a it scan can determine whether an enlarged lymph node is benign or malignant

will hiatal hernia problem stay forever,hello I can very well understand your concern and at the start I want to tell you that chronic straining does not lead to the development of hiatus hernia however your weight can hiatus hernia is an anatomical change that can present since birth and after certain surgical procedures over abdomen or diaphragm overweight to obese can develop hiatus hernia because of the excessive pressure over the stomach from belly fat causing upward lifting of the lower part of food pipe and formation of hernia and lastly due to the old age when the diaphragmatic muscle gets weakened allowing part of the lower esophagus to get pulled in the lower part of the chest in a young healthy people diaphragmatic muscle is strong enough to prevent this from happening valsalva maneuver if performed vigorously can cause tears in the lower part of the esophagus which is an acute complication of this but it will not alter the anatomy or produce a hiatus hernia valsalva can harm somebody if it is done without a reason there are certain indications for medical conditions but it can only cause damage to the lower part of the esophagus acutely but would not alter the anatomy of it I hiatus hernia yes an ray plain without contrast can easily miss a hiatus hernia a special ray with contrast named barium is swallowed and serial ray images from the chest are taken that can diagnose the hiatus hernia instantly however a plain chest ray cannot detect the presence of hiatus hernia so now coming to your second concern that you have to live with it well it is not yet proven that you have a hiatus hernia secondly it is not uncommon to have hiatus hernia in people without any symptoms and it can remain undiagnosed until their whole life the point is it can present harmlessly in human for years and years and does not necessitate any investigations the time to develop a hiatus hernia is variable but it does take many years of overweight to cause hiatus hernia very less likely within to 12 months time it is not a rule that every hiatus hernia would cause symptoms or disease or any complications I would not suggest you even to worry about it and get tested for it because it would not change anything for you simple exercises keeping a healthy lifestyle reduce weight are all that is required the weight loss is very compulsory this will not only help you preventing hiatus hernia but also other things like gastroesophageal reflux herd bloating gas distention constipation I hope this helps overweight barium swallow if worried about it or have symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux weight reduction follow up to discuss if any concern,hello doctor I am a 31 year old male who until recently weighed about 100 keg for the last six

will lamotrigine taken for tonic clonic seizures cause repetitive strange thoughts,hi as per the given information I can understand that these symptoms are the effects of seizure and unlikely to be due to lamotrigine the primary goal of the therapy is to control seizure episodes for which you have been prescribed brivaracetam you must start the new medicine along with the old one with which the symptoms must go mri magnetic resonance imaging scan may not reveal epileptogenic focus other than hippocampal sclerosis and some volume loss the best way to find epileptogenic focus would be eg electroencephalogram if possible can be done later if seizures are not controlled with the prescribed medicines,hi doctor I have been diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy following a tonic clonic seizure before nine years from then before two years I was seizure free having been put on lamotrigine before two years I had another to seizure and my dosage was raised cannot remember the dose precisely and I was seizure free for almost a year when I had another to seizure at this point my dosage was raised again to 125 my twice a day despite this I have had a number of absence seizures this seizure was followed by a 24 36 hour period of not just extreme tiredness but very strange mental sensations including what felt like a rush of intelligence as well as frequently repeating thoughts and unexplainable strange thoughts not distressing more like feelings of another time as well as what I guess are best defined as nonsense thought trains about advanced concepts such as genetics or psychology following this I had an mri which reported nothing abnormal say for a small number of tiny foi of to hyper intensity within the all white matter of both hemispheres non specific

recovered quickly and found sleep to be a major contributing factor to my recovery now just over 48 hours since my last seizure these symptoms have again subsided they have occasionally appeared prior

what is the chance of spread of hepatitis through food contaminated with blood,hello well the whole blood and serum white fluid within blood contains large amount of virus and virus can live on blood spots outside the human body for the duration of one week so actually it depends upon how much blood and how much time it has been on the stain that can determine the chances of acquiring infection if contaminated with food so I guess my answer can be partially answering your query if you tell me the exact event I may be in a better position to tell you the figures otherwise as a general rule hepatitis does not spread via food having said that it can still spread if blood contaminated food has been ingested since virus invades the human body when comes in close to mucosa lining of our mouth and then spread to blood within human this happens in the same way as one infected person can transmit infection via kissing hugging sharing of a towel spoon plates and so on if you are puzzled with all that information I want you to simply get a blood test for hepatitis infection it is a simple blood test that can give us a clue I hope this helps post exposure risk stratification hepatitis surface antigen hepatitis core total follow up after testing,hello doctor is there any chance of hepatitis spread through eating food contaminated with infected blood,medium severity,what is the chance of spread of hepatitis through food contaminated with blood hello doctor is there any chance of hepatitis spread through eating food contaminated with infected blood,medium severity,1,what is the chance of spread of hepatitis through food contaminated with blood hello doctor is there any chance of hepatitis spread through eating food contaminated with infected blood
I have abdominal discomfort with it showing lot of stools in bowel please help,hello I can imagine your reason of concern for such ongoing on and off symptoms well first of all if it were ulcerative or crohn disease it should have shown something abnormal on it scan which I presume it did not however remember the it scan reporting is completely a subjective thing it depends highly on the expertise of radiologist who has reported that I would urge if you upload the report in reply to this response I would be glad to see that there will be no charges for that I will allow you one free follow up now the presence of too many stools is not an uncommon finding on it scan since it is basically the function of the colon to reserve stools transit them timely in anterograde direction and finally to be evacuated through the rectum and anal canal if the presence of stool with dilation of the lumen of colon or presence of stools within small bowel fecalization of small bowel and or dilation of the lumen of small bowel suggest an alarming finding normally our small bowel does not usually contain stools it rapidly empties matter to in to large bowel hence the presence of stool in small bowel suggests an abnormal finding I will tell you why this information on it scan is important for example you have a normal size of the lumen of bowel ideally less than am of small bowel and less than am of large bowel with the symptoms you mention it can be irritable bowel syndrome with constipation if the diameter of the lumen is above the normal it can be functional constipation of which two further types the one is chronic colonic constipation or colonic pseudo obstruction called as ogilvie syndrome the other where the small bowel is dilated called chronic small bowel pseudo obstruction I hope you now have an idea why it is important to correlate symptoms with the it scan findings now coming to your symptoms the pain or discomfort is often common when bowel loops are distended with gas or stools and your discomfort which readily resolves after you have good bowel movements suggest the possibility of the same and not otherwise due to a serious underlying cause the intensity of discomfort that changes with the bowel movement again suggests it might secondary to irritable bowel syndrome is metamucil is fiber laxative and really it does not have any harm if taken for years and years the fiber is nonabsorbale molecule it does not go into blood circulation so have no side effects however in some it can cause bloating or belching you can switch to other fibers such as fibrocol if metamucil does not suit you otherwise it is completely normal if you want to resume the same take plenty of water it makes stool bulk large and soft and easy to pass I myself have a habit of taking liters of water in a day and this really makes wonder you should continue that I would wait for your it scan report to see the findings then I will right you some investigations to rule out other possibilities I believe you would not have anyone but just to be on the safe side,hi doctor I have been having abdominal discomfort for a while at first the discomfort was in the flank portion I went to a urologist he gave me muscle relaxers and a few tablets for clearing any small stones the discomfort went away after taking the medication but after some days may be due to sex or

water and fiber and do some exercises if the problem persists he asked to check with the general practitioner I had an appointment with my family physician who said the discomfort can be due to lack

I have hypothyearoidism and hashimoto and feel fatigued after a year of treatment why,hi good day and thanks for your query some people treated for hypothyearoidism may still experience symptoms even if blood tests show that their thyearoid stimulating hormone ash levels are well within the normal range the reasons for this are complex but the bottom line is that having a normal ash value does not necessarily mean that all of your symptoms will go away evidence suggests that situations like this are not as uncommon as one may think even when placed on levothyearoxine the drug considered the gold standard of hypothyearoid treatment many people fail to reap the physical benefits of treatment so first you can lower down your ash target if you are still having symptoms for that we can increase your medication if still symptomatic the next choice is to change the brand of thyearoxine and if still not feeling well then think to go to supplement rather than to that is thyearoxine thanks,hi doctor I have hypothyearoidism and hashimoto my doctor currently only tests my ash and treats me with levothyearoxine I feel extreme fatigue after a year of this treatment even with my ash in the normal range my doctor says free to and reverse to are not important labs to run I am wondering if I should see an endocrinologist or just continue the treatment I am on my ash started at 8 last year got down to 08 I feel great when it was that low mow my ash is 8 and I feel extreme fatigue I am taking 12 mug levothyearoxine daily thank you,high severity,I have hypothyearoidism and hashimoto and feel fatigued after a year of treatment why hi doctor I have hypothyearoidism and hashimoto my doctor currently only tests my ash and treats me with levothyearoxine I feel extreme fatigue after a year of this treatment even with my ash in the normal range my doctor says free to and reverse to are not important labs to run I am wondering if I should see an endocrinologist or just continue the treatment I am on my ash started at 8 last year got down to 08 I feel great when it was that low mow my ash is 8 and I feel extreme fatigue I am taking 12 mug levothyearoxine daily thank you,high severity,2,i have hypothyearoidism and hashimoto and feel fatigued after a year of treatment why hi doctor i have hypothyearoidism and hashimoto my doctor currently only tests my ash and treats me with levothyearoxine i feel extreme fatigue after a year of this treatment even with my ash in the normal range my doctor says free to and reverse to are not important labs to run i am wondering if i should see an endocrinologist or just continue the treatment i am on my ash started at 8 last year got down to 08 i feel great when it was that low mow my ash is 8 and i feel extreme fatigue i am taking 12 mug levothyearoxine daily thank you

which is the best medicine for rosacea,hello well here I discuss everything one by one for further information consult a dermatologist online,hello doctor I am 32 year old female my past medical history includes rosacea 15 years perioral dermatitis years melasma and hyperpigmentation in the upper cheeks for three years and add I am currently under noritate occasional elidel during flare up and adderall 5 my daily my hyperpigmentation on my upper cheeks has been progressively getting worse over the last several months the pigmentation is well demarcated with areas of normal skin I work indoors and the most sun I get on a daily basis is my short 15 minutes car ride from home to work I cannot pinpoint the cause of the hyperpigmentation and melasma I am not on any type of birth control and do not believe the source to be hormonal I am hesitant to try lightening agents as I have had adverse effects in the past I am going to trace back the pigmentation for you and maybe you can help me out before three years I applied noritate and diana to my face my skin in general was fine I had only one area of pigmentation on my face right side of face inch as that was noticeable I asked a dermatologist if there was anything that I could do to lighten it she gave me tri luma I decided to put the tri luma on the affected area and also a few freckles on my upper cheeks the next day I became extremely red and out of fear of triggering my rosacea I dropped tri luma immediately then after a month I stopped taking diana because I moved back to a colder climate and my face was getting too dry after some eight months the area of pigmentation right side of cheek was started getting darker so I decided to give another try for tri luma I again applied it to the larger area of pigmentation and to the tiny freckles on my upper cheeks the decision to apply it to the freckles was purely a cosmetic decision the next day those freckles turned into full blown pigmentation I immediately stopped the tri luma and the pigmentation in those areas has basically been there up to present day at that time a local dermatologist had suggested me to apply some cortisone cream to the areas to lighten them up the pigmentation subsided very minimally I did not apply the cortisone cream thereafter the pigmentation from this point waxed and waned in intensity up until two months back then it has remained prominent there were a few times during this two year span where my perioral dermatitis flared up and I was told to restart diana which also made the pigmentation worse I was unsure whether the diana was bringing the pigmentation to the surface or whether it was in fact making it worse I went to two dermatologists who had differing views of stop diana and keep using diana I decided to stop as it appeared to be getting noticeably worse again I do not know if this was a whole process of bringing the pigmentation to the surface or not please share your thoughts,low

why do I get vertigo while lying down and turning head towards left,hello I read your history and reviewed your total spinal mri do not be nervous vertigo that you are experiencing is not related to your discopathy you have disc bulging in the cervical spine c5 ca and ca c7 at least one mild disc bulging in the thoracic spine and two more disc problems in the lumbar area especially in la s1 that is complicated by spondylolisthesis I spinal body sliding nevertheless as I said none of them is related to vertigo your vertigo is a benign paroxysmal peripheral vertigo bppv that is caused due to a benign problem in one of your horizontal semicircular canal in the inner ear in simple words one of your sensors which reports the brain any horizontal rotation of the head suffers from a temporary problem and gives exaggerated data to the brain I agree with the prescribed medicine except the antibiotic azithromycin that seems unnecessary if you do not have a fever or ear pain the key treatment is not medicine please accept my advice and do not avoid the head movement that triggers your vertigo in contrast repeat it more and more in every try you will notice that the severity of vertigo will lessen it is similar to seasickness by repeating the movement and sending exaggerated data by your ear your brain habits the situation and will neglect the bad data and you will improve if this strategy does not work after five days in combination medicines then you will need to be treated by a maneuver that is called gufoni maneuver it should be done by a trained neurologist or ent specialist I hope this helps,hello doctor I am a 40 year old male I weigh about 79 keg and my height is 1 my be is 130 78 and pulse rate is 90 bum I have no diabetes and I am a non smoker and non alcoholic I am a software engineer I am having neck and back pain issues for the past 10 years particularly more severe neck pain for the last one week as my neck is hurting and pain is radiating into my head and shoulders etc till now there is no pain in my hands or fingers my job is computer programming so I have to focus hours on the screen this is one of the main reasons behind it as I never had any vehicle or sports accident now more terrible thing is that I have started vertigo spinning in head while lying down and move my head towards the left side because of this vertigo fear I kept laying straight on my back full night I can cope with the pain but vertigo spinning of my head is putting me under stress and depression as it could affect my daily life too I have taken thousands of medicines in the last ten years currently my doctor advised me some medicines which I am using since four days I take zenorit 8mg azithromycin lavistina 16 my betahistine dihydrochloride paragon chlorzoxazone 250 my and paracetamol 300 my and neurobion forte well my first question is what is the main reason for having vertigo spinning head while lying down and tilt the head on the left side my doctor has diagnosed that my ear is having balancing issue is that true however I guess any of my cervical disc pinches some nerve or artery while I lay down and turn my head as you can see from the mri report that almost all of my discs are having issues moreover regularly I do a light massage with deep heat cream and then keep a hot water bottle on my neck back for some time earlier I had some physiotherapy sessions as well for pain management however there is no chiropractor available in our city I will be greatly thankful to you if you could at least diagnose the root cause of this

is there any permanent cure for frequent bouts of respiratory infection in a kid,hello thanks for writing your query to me I can understand that you are very much concerned about the health of your son from your history description it seems that your son has bronchial asthma usually occurs from exposure to the allergens in our surrounding environment the main treatment of asthma is inhaler medicines like budecort inhaler 200 instead of giving him daily twice nebulizer I will recommend you to start him on budecort inhaler via zerostat vt spacer two puffs twice daily followed by gargling with water and levolin inhaler two puffs as required in an emergency on a long term basis inhaler medicines are not as harmful as they are having fewer side effects than tablets and syearups also as they act at the site of action a very minimal dose of medicine is required try to find out the allergens in his surroundings and avoid them as much as possible there is no need to deprive him of dairy products such as milk cheese or paneer unless he cannot tolerate them he needs to give it as it is the most important source of calcium and required for weight gain nebulization with budecort is only to be given when he is unable to take inhaler by mouth do not forget to rinse the mouth with water after taking inhaler or nebulizer no other therapy is better for optimal control of asthma as there is no cure for it homeotherapy also cannot cure asthma in the long run as there is no scientific evidence for it I hope everything is clear to you now,hello doctor this query is regarding my and a half year old son he was born at 36 weeks and progressed normally at around years of age he used to get frequent bouts of running nose and cough he was hospitalized for lower respiratory tract

is abnormal vaginal bleeding a sign of reproductive cancer,hi I believe this is the first episode of heavy intermenstrual bleeding or polymenorrhagia for you and during the mid cycle if the bleeding is not controlled and remains heavy causing anemia and dizziness as manifestation then to stop the bleed the best way would be to undertake a dilatation and curettage procedure through which can remove the endometrium and subject sample for histopathological exam to rule out any endometrial hyperplasia and accompanied atypia which may indicate towards an endometrial cancer depending on the reports at present wait and watch for excessive bleeding for few more days and if it does not reduce then review with er and get the ultrasound done sooner and further evaluation keep yourself well

will manasamitra vatakam and saraswatiristam help in palpitation after clonazepam withdrawal,hello I could understand how much confusion you experience and your mental pain so far fewer studies have been done if we combine allopathy drugs with ayurveda or siddha drugs in your case I feel you should continue the allopathy drugs for 15 days or above as per physicians instruction I feel you can also have propranolol to reduce the palpitation you can continue the allopathy drugs for particular days in order to avoid the addiction the gradual stepwise dose reduction of tablets should be followed for example from day 16th onwards half tablet to be continued for next one week then every alternate days half tablet for next one week then every ith day half a tablet for next week then stop it this can be done with the advice of the physician few research in animals has proved that manasamitra tablet could increase serotonin levels but not 100 guarantee given many clinical sharing concludes that these three ayurvedic drugs are useful if the patient starts the therapy in the early stage of the disease and also good for long term treatment hence in your case adding these drugs will surely have some beneficial role you do not stop these ayurvedic drugs continue it for the next six months you join for a regular yoga class or training class daily continuously for the next six months in my experience after six months you can stop all medications including ayurveda and can run the best life only with yoga practice yoga practice at home is free of cost many people got miracle relief from

what are the symptoms of mercury toxicity,hello I read carefully your question and would explain that your symptoms are not typical of mercury intoxication anyway I would recommend performing nerve conduction to in order to examine your nerves and a brain mri in order to examine your brain as the neurological exam is normal I do not think it the brain mri will result abnormal a cervical spine mri may be necessary too in order to exclude possible spinal cord compression in this region due to a bulging disc,hello doctor I have multiple questions recently I might have been exposed to mercury vapor in a hotel room I was sleeping in for around 10 hours the room was small and the type of mercury was unknown I remember the one type of chemical was clear liquid watery substance and the other once was more clay grey with dissolved in water I left the room around 10 hours later and did not touch anything but I might have breathed in the vapors in this small room I also washed away the crystals that has landed on the carpet all of these substances I have no clue about what was except when I asked I was told mercury 5 months later I got a pins and needles feeling in arms and feet with has lasted a month but no other symptoms until now I feel like I have some kind of internal vibration in my feet and my knees are shaking when I stand up like I am freezing or have done a hard workout from time to time I went to the doctor in my area and told him about what had happened and showed him pictures of the various substances and I took a urine test and a blood test and this was made around 130 days after possible initial exposure and the test came back at normal levels but can it be that I had a toxic exposure and the mercury has already settled in organs and therefore do not show in blood or urine I am not sure about the half life times in these metals or can I settle down and accept the test results are final and that mercury levels do indeed declear that I have not had an exposure of toxic levels and that my symptoms might be of other cause if not number one is the cause then a few months before that I got an acute pins and needles feeling in hands and feet paresthesia which continued until today and it increased over the one month before it stabilized a little it went from pins and burning sensations different parts of the hands and pins feeling in the legs a few times I got shooting pain from a finger and up my arm but very rarely which has not returned after alcohol consumption one weekend it went from stabilized to worse and I also noticed my

18 my which was several years ago when I was in my 20 but most recently and over the past year my levels have averaged in the 134 137 my range for my age I have been overweight for close to 10 years I had never dieter or limited my cholesterol intake I began researching online for any information that might explain levels this low while there is an abundance of information regarding high cholesterol regarding its causes and risks there is practically no information available regarding low cholesterol levels or causes outside of the obvious low cholesterol intake vegetarian or vegan

how to cure the acne breakouts,hi for further information consult a dermatologist online,hi doctor I have had good skin for all my life people would even compliment me on it at times this changed a while ago I have been involved in bodybuilding for the last year and decided to start taking creatine roughly three months ago before that I did not notice any effect of exercise on my skin except some small pimples on my chin area after a month of creatine usage I realized that my skin was getting worse with some breakouts all over my face forehead and temples and especially chin and low jawline area I first removed the protein supplement from my diet thinking it was the cause and only 2 weeks later realized upon the research that creatine was the real culprit I instantly stopped taking it and the only supplement I take now is natural dairy free protein powder along with the skin care regimen I follow this every day I am using a cleanser along with moisturizer twice a day and it has helped almost to clear my forehead and temples I assumed my breakouts were due to dehydration in the period I was taking creatine but only noticed slight progress in my chin area although the bumps on my skin now do not feel as tough and dry as they did and do not itch anymore unless I forget to moisturize I drink lots of water and have just bought a 97 pure aloe vera gel tube that I am going to apply twice a day I am afraid whether this condition could last a long time after quitting creatine I am really worried as it is seriously damaging my confidence and overall wellbeing is

to contact your local dermatologist there are several methods of managing viral warts that may be electrocautery or simple local application of antiviral or keratolytic ointments that will be decided by your dermatologist if you are having phimosis then contact your local urologist as you may need circumcision if you undergo circumcision the skin with these lesions will automatically be excised out and biopsy report will tell the final story,hello doctor I would like to get a second opinion and ask a few more questions regarding the condition that I have on my foreskin I am 43 years old and I have two brown spots on my foreskin they are there for about one to two years possibly longer they do not itch or bleed or change in size only the one is closer to the glans is possibly getting a bit lighter can you please have a look at the photos and opinion of a dermatologist they suggest that it could be condyloma bowenoid papulosis or seborrheic keratosis as I mentioned when I was younger

thyearoiditis being treated with medication this only means that you are being correctly treated with respect to your thyearoid function the few white hair that you noted could be due to stress that you have in your day to day life or simply without any reason they can occur they have nothing to do with your thyearoid function your breakfast is good but maybe the doctor meant to decrease the
